1. Jesus, our Lord, make no delay
To meet us with thy love;
Drive interposing clouds away,
And make our guilt remove.


2. What do we here without thy grace,
O blessed Lamb of God?
’Twill be a dark and tiresome place,
Unless we feel thy word.


3. Come in with power to ev’ry soul,
O thou immortal Dove;
Make every wounded spirit whole,
With thy redeeming love.


4. We long to meet our God to-day,
And taste his grace divine;
That every soul with joy may say,
My Lord, my God, we’re thine.
