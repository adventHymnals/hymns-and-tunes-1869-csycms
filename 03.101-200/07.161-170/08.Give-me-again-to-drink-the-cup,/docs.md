1. Give me again to drink the cup,
And taste the sacred bread,
That tells how Jesus on the cross 
For me a sinner bled;
And let me feel as once I felt,
Like some pure, gushing rill,
The mem’ry of his dying love,
Through all my being thrill.


2. Give me again to drink the cup,
And taste the sacred bread,
That tells how he whose weary feet 
Up Calvary’s hill did tread,
Shall in a grand triumphal march 
Return again to earth,
And wake his humble followers 
To an immortal birth.


3. And though he tasteth now no more
The red blood of the vine,
He then shall take the cup anew 
And drink the heavenly wine;
Shall break the bread of life once more, 
To all that joyful band 
Who shall as marriage guests sit down,
In the immortal land.


4. Then let me take again once more
These emblems that I love,
To lead my thoughts away from earth,
Up to the courts above;
To cause my hopes to grow more bright; 
For the glad coming day;
To give me strength a little while,
To wait and watch and pray.
