^Meter:^ ^^105^
1. To-day the Saviour calls!
Ye wanderers, come!
O ye benighted souls,
Why longer roam?


2. To-day the Saviour calls!
Oh! listen now;
Within these sacred walls,
To Jesus bow.


3. To-day the Saviour calls!
For mercy flee;
For all the guilty soon
Must guilty be.


4. To-day the Saviour calls!
For refuge fly;
The storm of vengeance falls;
Ruin is nigh.


5. The Spirit calls to-day!
Yield to its power;
Oh! grieve it not away;
’Tis mercy’s hour.
