1. Approach, my soul, the mercy-seat,
Where Jesus answers prayer;
There humbly fall before his feet,
For none can perish there.


2. Thy promise is my only pleaâ€”
With this I venture nigh;
Thou callest burdened souls to thee 
And such, O Lord, am I.


3. Bowed down beneath a load of sin,
By Satan sorely pressed,
By war without, and fears within 
I come to thee for rest.


4. Be thou my shield and hiding-place, 
That, sheltered near thy side,
I may my fierce accuser face,
And tell him thou hast died.


5. Oh, wondrous love! to bleed and die, 
To bear the cross and shame,
That guilty sinners, such as I,
Might plead thy gracious name.
