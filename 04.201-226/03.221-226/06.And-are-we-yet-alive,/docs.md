1. And are we yet alive,
And see each other’s face?
Glory and praise to Jesus give 
For his redeeming grace.


2. Preserved by power divine
To full salvation here,
Again in Jesus’ praise we join,
And in his sight appear.


3. What troubles have we seen?
What conflicts have we passed? 
Fightings without, and fears within, 
Since we assembled last.


4. But out of all, the Lord
Hath brought us by his love;
And still his help he doth afford,
And hides our life above.


5. Then let us make our boast
Of his redeeming power,
Which saves us to the uttermost,
Till we can sin no more.


6. Let us take up the cross,
Till we the crown obtain;
And gladly reckon all things loss,
So we may Jesus gain.
