1. Blessed Jesus, heavenly Lamb,
Thine and only thine I am:
Take me, body, spirit, soul;
Only thou possess the whole.


2. Thou my one thing needful be;
Let me ever cleave to thee;
Let me choose the better part;
Let me give thee all my heart.


3. Fairer than the sons of men!
Do not let me turn again,
Nor the Fountain-head of bliss,
Leave for creature happiness.
