1. Lord of the Sabbath and its light,
I hail thy hallowed day of rest;
It is my weary soul’s delight,
The solace of my care-worn breast.


2. O sacred day of peace and joy,
Thy hours are ever dear to me;
Ne’er may a sinful thought destroy
The holy calm I find in thee.


3. O Jesus, let me ever hail
Thy presence with the day of rest;
Then will thy servant never fail
To deem thy Sabbath doubly blest.
