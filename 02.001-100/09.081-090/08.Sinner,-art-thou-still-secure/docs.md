1. Sinner, art thou still secure?
Wilt thou still refuse to pray?
Can thy heart or hands endure 
In the Lord’s avenging day?
See, his mighty arm is bared;
Awful terrors clothe his brow!
For his judgments stand prepared; 
Thou must either break or bow.


2. At his presence nature shakes;
Earth atfrighted hastes to flee; 
Solid mountains melt like wax;
What will then become o f thee? 
Who his advent may abide?
You that glory in your shame,
W ill you find a place to hide,
When the world is wrapt in flame?
