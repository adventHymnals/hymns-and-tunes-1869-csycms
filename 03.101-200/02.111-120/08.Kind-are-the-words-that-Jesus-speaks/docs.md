1. Kind are the words that Jesus speaks
To cheer the drooping saint;
My grace sufficient is for you,
Though nature’s powers may faint.


2. My grace its glories shall display,
And make your griefs remove;
Your weakness shall the triumphs tell
Of boundless power and love.


3. O thou, my Saviour and my Lord,
’Tis good to trust thy name;
Thy power, thy faithfulness and love,
Will ever be the same.


4. Weak as I am, yet through thy grace
I all things can perform,
And, smiling, triumph in thy name
Amid the raging storm.
