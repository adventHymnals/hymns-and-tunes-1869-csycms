1. Come on, my partners in distress
My comrades in the wilderness,
Who still your burdens feel;
Awhile forget your griefs and fears,
And look beyond the vale of tears,
To yon celestial hill.


2. Look far beyond this narrow space,
Look forward to that heavenly place,
The saints’ secure abode.
On faith’s strong eagle pinions rise,
And force your passage to the skies,
Strong in the strength of God.


3. Who suffer with their Master here,
Shall soon before his face appear,
And by his side sit down;
To patient faith the prize is sure;
And all that to the end endure
The cross, shall wear the crown.


4. Thrice blessed, bliss-inspiring hope!
It lifts the fainting spirit up;
It brings to life the dead;
Our conflicts here shall soon be past,
And you and I ascend at last,
Triumphant with our Head.
