1. Thy presence, gracious God, afford;
Prepare us to receive thy word;
Now let thy voice engage our ear,
And faith be mixed with what we hear.


2. Distracting thoughts and cares remove,
And fix our hearts on things above;
With food divine may we be fed,
And satisfied with living bread.


3. To each thy sacred word apply,
With sovereign power and energy;
And may we in thy faith and fear
Reduce to practice what we hear.
