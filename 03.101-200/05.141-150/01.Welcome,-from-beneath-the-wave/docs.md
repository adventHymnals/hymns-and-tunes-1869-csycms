1. Welcome, from beneath the wave
With your Saviour rising,
Trusting in his power to save, 
Earthly hopes despising;
Welcome to the Christian band,
Who have gone before thee, 
Pilgrims to a better land,
Pressing on to glory.


2. Dead with him who died for you,
Dead to sin and flly;
Risen with him to live anew,
Live to trust him wholly.
Let each worldly striving cease;
Run the race before thee;
Christ is all your life and peace,— 
Christ the hope of glory.


3. If with Christ we die and rise,
In this world of sadness,
We shall meet him in the skies,
When he comes, with gladness;
In that resurrection day 
We shall share his glory,
And to all eternity 
Shout redemption’s story.
