1. Come, sacred Dove, in peace descend, 
Now with this scene thine influence blend, 
As once thou didst on Jordan’s wave;
And hover o’er this solemn grave.


2. We sink beneath thy mystic flood;
Oh! bathe us in thy cleansing blood!
We die to sin, and seek a grave,
With thee, beneath the yielding wave.
