1. EYE hath not seen, ear hath not heard,
Nor sense nor reason known,
What joy s the Father hath prepared 
For those that love his Son.


2. But the good Spirit of the Lord
Reveals a Heaven to come;
The beams o f glory in his word 
Allure and guide us home.


3. Pure is the land the saints espy,
And all the region peace;
No wanton lips nor envious eye 
Can see or taste the bliss.


4. Those holy gates forever bar
Pollution, sin and shame;
None shall obtain admittance there 
But followers of the Lamb.
