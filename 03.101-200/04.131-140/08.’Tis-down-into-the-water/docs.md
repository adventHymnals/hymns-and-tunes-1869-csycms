^Meter:^ ^^138^
1. ’Tis down into the water
Where we believers go,
To serve our Lord and Master
In righteous acts below;
We lay our mortal bodies
Beneath the yielding wave,
An emblem of the Saviour,
When he lay in the grave.


2. The light of truth is spreading,
And shining now for thee;
And sweet its notes are sounding
To set the captive free;
And while this glorious message
Is circulated round,
Some souls exposed to ruin,
Redeeming grace have found.


3. And of that happy number,
I hope that I am one;
And Jesus soon will finish 
The work he has begun.
Then let us take new courage, 
That we may travel on,
Till he shall come in glory 
To take his children home
