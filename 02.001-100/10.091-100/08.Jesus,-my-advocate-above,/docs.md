^Meter:^ ^LM^
1. Jesus, my advocate above,
My friend before the throne of love,
If now for me prevails thy prayer,
If now I find thee pleading there


2. Jesus, my heartâ€™s desire obtain;
My earnest suit present, and gain;
My fullness of corruption show;
The knowledge of myself bestow.


3. Save me from death; from hell set free, 
Death, hell, are but the want of thee: 
My life, my only Heaven thou art
Oh! might I feel thee in my heart.
