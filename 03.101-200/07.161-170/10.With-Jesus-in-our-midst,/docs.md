1. With Jesus in our midst,
We gather round the board;
Though many, we are one in Christ,
One body in the Lord.


2. Our sins were laid on him
When bruised on Calvary;
For us he died, and rose again,
A pledge of victory.


3. Faith eats the bread of life,
And drinks the living wine;
Thus we, in love together knit,
On Jesus’ breast recline.


4. Soon shall the night be gone,
And we with Jesus reign;
The marriage supper of the Lamb 
Shall banish every pain.


5. Then let our powers unite,
His glorious name to raise;
And holy joy fill every mind,
And every voice be praise.
