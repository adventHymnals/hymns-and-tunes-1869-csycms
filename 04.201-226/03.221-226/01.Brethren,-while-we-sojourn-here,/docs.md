1. Brethren, while we sojourn here,
Fight we must, but should not fear;
Foes we have, but we’ve a Friend,
One who loves us to the end.
Forward then with courage go,
Long we shall not dwell below;
Soon the joyful news will come,
Child, your Father calls—Come home.


2. In the world a thousand snares
Lie to take us unawares;
Satan, with malicious art,
Watches each unguarded heart;
But from Satan’s malice free,
Saints shall soon victorious be;
Soon the joyful news will come,
Child, your Father calls—Come home.


3. But of all the foes we meet,
None so apt to turn our feet,
None betray us into sin,
Like the foes we have within;
Yet let nothing spoil your peace, 
Christ will also conquer these;
Then the joyful news will come,
Child, your Father calls— Come home.
