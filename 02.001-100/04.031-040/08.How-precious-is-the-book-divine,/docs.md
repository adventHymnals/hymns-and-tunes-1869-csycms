1. How precious is the book divine,
By inspiration given;
Bright as a lamp its doctrines shine,
To guide our souls to Heaven.


2. It sweetly cheers our drooping hearts
In this dark vale of tears,
And life, and light, and joy imparts,
And banishes our fears.


3. This lamp, through all the tedious night
Of life, shall guide our way,
Till we behold the clearer light
Of an eternal day.
