^Meter:^ ^SM^
1. How happy are our ears,
That hear the joyful sound,
Which kings and prophets waited for,
And sought, but never found!


2. How blessed are our eyes,
That see this heavenly light;
Prophets and kings desired it long,
But died without the sight!


3. The watchmen join their voice,
And tuneful notes employ;
Jerusalem breaks forth in songs,
And deserts learn the joy.
