1. Awake! Jerusalem, awake!
No longer in thy sins lie down;
The garment of salvation take,
Thy beauty and thy strength put on.


2. Shake off the dust that blinds thy sight,
And hides the promise from thine eyes
Arise, and struggle into light,
The great Deliverer calls, Arise!


3. Shake off the bands of sad despair,
Zion, assert thy liberty;
Look up, thy broken heart prepare,
And God shall set the captive free.


4. Vessels of mercy, sons of grace,
Be purged from every sinful stain,
Be like your Lord, his word embrace,
Nor bear his hallowed name in vain.


5. The Lord shall in your heart appear,
And lead the mighty triumph on;
His glory shall bring up the rear,
And perfect what his grace begun.
