1. For a season called to part,
Let us now ourselves commend
To the gracious eye and heart
Of our ever-present Friend.


2. Jesus, hear our humble prayer;
Tender Shepherd of thy sheep,
Let thy mercy and thy care
All our souls in safety keep.


3. In thy strength we may be strong;
Sweeten every cross and pain;
And our wasting lives prolong,
Till we meet on earth again.
