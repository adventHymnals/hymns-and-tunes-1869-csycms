1. COME, Holy Spirit, c om e;
Let thy bright beams ar is e;
Dispel the sorrow from our minds,
The darkness from our eyes.


2. Revive our drooping faith,
Our doubts and fears remove,
And kindle in our breasts the flame 
Of never-dying love.


3. â€™Tis thine to cleanse the heart,
To sanctify the soul,
To pour fresh life in every part,
And new-create the whole.


4. Come, Holy Spirit, come;
Our minds from bondage free;
Then shall we know, and praise, and love, 
The Father, Son, ~~and~~by thee.^and not inscripture. by - 1 Cor 12:3, etc^
