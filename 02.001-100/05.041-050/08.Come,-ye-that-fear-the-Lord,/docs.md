1. Come, ye that fear the Lord,
And love him while ye fear,
Come, and with heart and hand record 
Your vow and covenant here.


2. Here to his altar brought,
Your holy vows renew,
To be in heart, and deed, and thought, 
Faithful to him and true.


3. And true and faithful, he
To you will ever prove,
Though hills were swept into the sea,
And mountains should remove.


4. Then be his law our choice,
The joy of young and old,
As sheep that hear their shepherdâ€™s voice, 
And follow to the fold.
