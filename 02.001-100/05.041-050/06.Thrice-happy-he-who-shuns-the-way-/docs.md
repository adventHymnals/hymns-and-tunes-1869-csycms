1. Thrice happy he who shuns the way 
That leads ungodly men astray;
Who fears to stand where sinners meet,
Nor with the scorner takes his seat.


2. The law of God is his delight;
That cloud by day, that fire by night,
Shall be his comfort in distress,
And guide him through life’s wilderness.


3. His works shall prosper: he shall be 
A fruitful, fair, unwith’ring tree,
That, planted where the river flows,
Nor drought, nor frost, nor mildew knows.


4. Not so the wicked; they are cast
Like chaff before the whirlwind’s blast;
In judgment they shall quake for dread,
Nor with the righteous lift their head.
