1. Lord of the Sabbath, hear us pray,
In this thy house, on this thy day;
Accept, as grateful sacrifice,
The songs which from thy temple rise.


2. Now met to pray, and bless thy name, 
Whose mercies flow each day the same, 
Whose kind compassions never cease,
We seek instruction, pardon, peace.


3. We love thine earthly Sabbaths, Lord;
A nobler rest thou wilt afford;
Oh! that we might that rest attain 
From sin, from sorrow, and from pain.


4. In thy blest kingdom we shall be 
From every mortal trouble free;
No sighs shall mingle with the songs 
Resounding from immortal tongues.
