1. Love divine, all love excelling,
Joy of Heaven, to earth come down!
Fix in us thy humble dwelling;
All thy faithful mercies crown,


2. Jesus! thou art all compassion,â€”
Pure, unbounded love thou art;
Visit us with thy salvation,
Enter every trembling heart.


3. Breathe, oh! breathe thy loving Spirit
Into every troubled breast!
Let us all in thee inherit;
Let us find thy promised rest.


4. Come, almighty to deliver,
Let us all thy grace receive! 
Suddenly return, and never,
Never more thy temples leave!


5. Finish then thy new creation,
Pure and spotless may we be;
Let us see our whole salvation 
Perfectly secured by thee.


6. Changed from glory into glory,
Till in Heaven we take our place; 
Till we cast our crowns before thee, 
Lost in wonder, love, and praise.
