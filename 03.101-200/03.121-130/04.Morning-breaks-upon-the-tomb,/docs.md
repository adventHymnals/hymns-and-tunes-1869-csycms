1. Morning breaks upon the tomb,
Jesus scatters all its gloom;
Day of triumph through the skies,
See the glorious Saviour rise.


2. Ye who are of death afraid,
Triumph in the scattered shade;
Drive your anxious cares away;
See the place where Jesus lay.


3. Christian! dry your flowing tears, 
Chase your unbelieving fears;
Look on his deserted grave;
Doubt no more his power to save.
