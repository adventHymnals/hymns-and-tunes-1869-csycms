1. How prone are professors to rest on their lees,
To study their pleasure, their profit and ease; 
Though God says, Arise, and escape for thy life, 
And look not behind you, Remember Lot’ s wife.


2. Awake from thy slumbers, the warning believe, 
’Tis Jesus that calls you, the message receive; 
While dangers are pending, escape for thy life! 
And look not behind you; Remember Lot’s wife.


3. The first bold apostate will tempt you to stay,
And tell you that lions are found in the way;
He means to deceive you, escape for thy li fe!
And look not behind you; remember Lot’s w ife!


4. How many poor souls has the tempter beguiled! 
With specious temptations how many defiled!
Oh, be not deluded, escape for thy life,
And look not behind you; remember Lot’s w ife!


5. The ways of religion true pleasure afford,
No pleasures can equal the joys of the Lord; 
Forsake then the world and escape for thy life, 
And look not behind you; remember Lot’s wife.


6. But if you determine the call to refuse,
And venture the way of destruction to choose,
For hell, you will part with the blessings of life, 
And then, if not now, you’ll remember Lot’s wife!
