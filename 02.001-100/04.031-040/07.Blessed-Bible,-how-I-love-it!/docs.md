1. Blessed Bible, how I love it!
How it doth my bosom cheer!
What hath earth like this to covet?
Oh! what stores of wealth are here.
’Tis a fountain ever bursting,
Whence the weary may obtain
Water for the soul that’s thirsting,
And shall never thirst again.


2. ’Tis a mine of richest treasure,
Laden with the purest ore;
And its contents without measure,
You can never well explore.
’Tis a lamp forever burning,
By whose never-dying light,
Sinners from their errors turning,
Are directed through the night.


3. ’Tis a chart that never fails you,
One which God to man has given;
And though rudest storms assail you,
It will guide you safe to Heaven. 
’Tis a pearl of price, exceeding
All the gems in ocean found;
To its precepts ever listen,—
In its truths may you abound.
