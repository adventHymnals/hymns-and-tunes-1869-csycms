1. All praise to our redeeming Lord,
Who joins us by his grace,
And bids us, each to each restored,
Together seek his face.

2. He bids us build each other up;
And gathered into one,
To our high callingâ€™s glorious hope,
We hand in hand go on.


3. The gift which he on one bestows,
We all delight to prove;
The grace through every vessel flows,
In purest streams of love.


4. And if our fellowship below
In Jesus be so sweet,
What height of rapture shall we know,
When round his throne we meet!
