1. Oh, for a heart to praise my God!
A heart from sin set free!
A heart that’s sprinkled with the blood
So freely shed for-me!


2. A humble, lowly, contrite heart,
Believing, true, and clean,
Which neither life nor death can part
From him that dwells within.


3. A heart in every thought renewed,
And filled with love divine!
Perfect, and right, and pure, and good,
A copy, Lord, of thine!


4. Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart;
Come quickly from above;
Write thy new name upon my heart.
Thy new, best name of love.
