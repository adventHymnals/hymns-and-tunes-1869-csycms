1. Jesus, at thy command,
I launch into the deep;
And leave my native land,
Where sin lulls all asleep;
For thee I would the world resign,
And sail to Heaven with thee and thine.


2. Thou art my pilot, wise,
My compass is thy word;
My soul each storm defies,
While I have such a Lord;
I’ll trust thy faithfulness and power,
To save me in the trying hour.


3. Though rocks and quicksands deep
Through all my passage lie,
Yet Christ will safely keep,
And guard me with his eye;
My anchor, hope, will firm abide,
And every boist’rous storm outride.


4. By faith I see the land,
The port of endless rest;
Through grace I hope to stand
And sing among the blest.
Oh! may I reach the heavenly shore,
Where winds and waves distress no more!


5. Whene’er becalmed I lie,
When wind and storm subside,
Then to my succor fly
And keep me near thy side;
For more the treacherous calm I dread,
Than tempests bursting o’er my head.


6. O Come, heavenly wind, and blow
A prosperous gale of grace;
Waft me from all below,
To Heaven, my destined place;
There, in full sail, my port I’ll find,
And leave the world and sin behind.
