1. Wait, O my soul, thy Maker’s will,
Tumultuous passions all be still,
Nor let a murmuring thought arise;
His ways are just, his counsels wise.


2. He in the thickest darkness dwells,
Performs his work, the cause conceals;
And though his footsteps are unknown,
Judgment and truth support his throne.


3. In Heaven, and earth, and air, and seas,
He executes his firm decrees,
And by his saints it stands confessed,
That what he does is ever best.


4. Wait then, my soul, submissive wait,
With reverence bow before his seat,
And ’mid the terrors of his rod,
Trust in a wise and gracious God.
