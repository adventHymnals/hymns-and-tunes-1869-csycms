1. How pleasant, how divinely fair,
O Lord of hosts, thy dwellings are!
With long desire my spirit faints
To meet th’ assemblies of thy saints.


2. My flesh would rest in thine abode,
My panting heart cries out for God;
My God, My King, why should I be
So far from all my joys and thee?


3. Blest are the souls that find a place
Within the temple of thy grace:
There they behold thy gentler rays,
And seek thy face, and learn thy praise.


4. Blest are the men whose hearts are set
To find the way to Zion’s gate;
God is their strength: and through the road
They lean upon their helper, God.


5. Cheerful they walk with growing strength, 
Till all shall meet in Heaven at length;
Till all before thy face appear,
And join in nobler worship there.
