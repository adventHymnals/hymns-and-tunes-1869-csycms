^Meter:^ ^7s^
1. Welcome, welcome, day of rest,
To the world in kindness given;
Welcome to this humble breast,
As the beaming light from Heaven.


2. Day of calm and sweet repose,
Gently now thy moments run;
Balm to soothe our cares and woes,
Till our labor here is done.


3. Holy day that most we prize,
Day of solemn praise and prayer;
Day to make the simple wise,
Oh! how great thy blessings are!


4. Welcome, welcome, day of rest,
With thy influence ail divine;
May thy hallowed hours be blessed,
To this waiting heart of mine.
