1. Thy holy Sabbath, Lord,
Thy people hail with joy;
And while we wait to hear thy word, 
Let praise our hearts employ.


2. With sweet delight, the day
That thou hast called thine own, 
We hail, and all our homage pay 
To thy exalted throne.


3. Oh! may thy saints be blest;
Assist us while we pr ay;
May we enjoy a holy rest,
And keep the sacred day.
