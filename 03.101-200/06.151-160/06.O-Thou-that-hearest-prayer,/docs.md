1. O Thou that hearest prayer,
Attend our humble cry,
And let thy servants share
Thy blessing from on high;
We plead the promise of thy word;
Grant us thy Holy Spirit, Lord.


2. If earthly parents hear
Their children when they cry;
If they, with love sincere,
Their varied wants supply;
Much more wilt thou thy love display,
And answer when thy children pray.


3. Our heavenly Father, thou;
We, children of thy grace;
Oh, let thy Spirit now
Descend and fill the place!
So shall we feel the heavenly flame,
And all unite to praise thy name.
