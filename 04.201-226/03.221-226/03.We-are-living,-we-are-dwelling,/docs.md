1. We are living, we are dwelling,
In a grand and awful time;
In an age on ages telling—
To be living is sublime.
Hark! the waking up of nations,
Gog and Magog to the fray;
Hark! what soundeth? Is creation 
Groaning for its latter day?


2. Christian, rouse and arm for conflict,
Nerve thee for the battle-field;
Bear the helmet of salvation,
And the mighty gospel shield;
Let the breastplate, peace, be on thee,
Take the Spirit’s sword in hand;
Boldly, fearlessly, go forth then,
In Jehovah’s strength to stand.


3. Wicked spirits gather round thee,
Legions of those foes to God—
Principalities most mighty—
Walk unseen the earth abroad;
They are gathering to the battle,
Strengthened for the last deep strife;
Christian, arm! be watchful, ready,
Struggle manfully for life.


4. And the prince of evil spirits,
Great deceiver of the world!
He who at the blessed Jesus
Once his deadly weapons hurled,
Cometh with unwonted power,
Knowing thai his reign will cease
In a little, and the kingdom
Given to the Prince of peace.


5. Christian, rouse! fight in this warfare,
Cease not till the victory’s won;
Till your Captain loud proclaimeth,
Servant of the Lord, well done!
He, alone, who thus is faithful,
Who abideth to the end,
Hath the promise, in the kingdom
An eternity to spend.
