1. We are sinful: cleanse us, Lord;
We are faint: thy strength afford; 
Lost,— until by thee restored,
O thou Comforter Divine!


2. Like the dew, thy peace distill; 
Guide, subdue, our wayward will, 
Things of Christ unfolding still,
O thou Comforter Divine!


3. In us, for us, intercede,
And, with voiceless groanings, plead 
Our unutterable need,
O thou Comforter Divine!


4. In us “Abba, Father,” cry,— 
Earnest of our bliss on high,
Seal for immortality,—
O thou Comforter Divine!


5. Search for us the depths of God; 
Bear us up the starry road,
To the height of thine abode,
O thou Comforter Divine!
