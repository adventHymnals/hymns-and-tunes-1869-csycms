1. Prayer is appointed to convey
The blessings God designs to give;
Long as they live should Christians pray;
They learn to pray when first they live.


2. If pains afflict, or wrongs oppress,
If cares distract, or fears dismay,
If guilt deject, if sin distress,
in every case, still watch and pray.


3. ’Tis prayer supports the soul that’s weak,
Though thought be broken, language lame;
Pray, it thou canst or canst not speak,
But pray with faith, in Jesus’ name.


4. Depend on Him; thou canst not fail;
Make all thy wants and wishes known;
Fear not, his merits must prevail!
Ask but in faith, it shall be done.
