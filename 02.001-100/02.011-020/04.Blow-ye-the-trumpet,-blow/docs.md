1. Blow ye the trumpet, blow
The gladly-solemn sound;
Let all the nations know,
To earth’s remotest bound,
The year of Jubilee is come;
Return, ye ransomed sinners, home.


2. Ye slaves of sin and hell,
Your liberty receive,
And safe in Jesus dwell,
And blest in Jesus live.
The year of Jubilee is come;
Return, ye ransomed sinners, home.


3. Ye who have sold for naught
Your heritage above,
Shall have it back unbought,
The gift of Jesus’ love.
The year of Jubilee is come;
Return, ye ransomed sinners, home.


4. The gospel trumpet hear,
The news of heavenly grace;
And, saved from earth, appear 
Before your Saviour’s face.
The year of Jubilee is come;
Return, ye ransomed sinners, home.
