1. Buried with Christ! yes, thus we lie
Immersed beneath the wave;
So he, the Saviour from on high,
Found on this earth his grave.


2. We rise with him! to live anew
A holy life of faith;
Believing what this brings to view,
And what the Scripture saith.


3. The glorious resurrection morn!
When Jesus from the skies 
Descending, whence he now hath gone, 
Shall bid the sleeping rise.


4. Eternal life we then receive 
From him, our blessed Lord; 
Our trials and our crosses leave, 
And reap their rich reward.
