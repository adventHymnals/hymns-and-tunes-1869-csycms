1. Soldier of Christ, arise,
And put your armor on;
Fight, for the battle will be ours;
We fight to win a crown.


2. We fight not against flesh;
We wrestle not with blood;
But principalities and powers,
And for the truth of God;


3. With wicked spirits, too,
That in high places stand,
Perverting oft the word of God,
And say ’tis by command.


4. Put all the armor on,
Like valiant soldiers stand;
Let all your loins be girt with truth,
Waiting our Lord’s command.


5. While Jesus is our friend,
And his rich grace supplies,
We’ll march like valiant soldiers on;
We’re sure to win the prize.


6. The battle’s almost o’er;
The race is nearly run;
Then with our glorious, conq’ring King,
W e’ll sit down on his throne.
