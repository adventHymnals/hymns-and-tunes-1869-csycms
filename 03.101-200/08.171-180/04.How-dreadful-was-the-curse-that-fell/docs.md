1. How dreadful was the curse that fell
On sinful man; ’twas death and hell;
Eternal death, destruction sure:
Who, who, such portion could endure?


2. But glory be to God on high!
Redemption comes, Good news, they cry—
The holy throng— th’ Anointed One
Descends to earth, God’s holy Son,


3. And dies for man, then lives again
A victor: he the foe hath slain;
Abolished death— oh, wondrous plan!
Salvation brought to fallen man.


4. The gift of God, like him, divine!
Here boundless love and mercy shine! 
Eternal life! In grateful lays 
Resound his everlasting praise.


5. Oh! may we be the truly wise,
Who seek with all our hearts this prize;
Contend no more for earth’s renown,
But look for an immortal crown.
