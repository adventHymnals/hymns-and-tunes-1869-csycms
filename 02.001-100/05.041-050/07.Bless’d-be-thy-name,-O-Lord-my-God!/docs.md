1. Bless’d be thy name, O Lord my God!
To me thy laws unfold;
And loud my lips shall tell abroad,
Whate’er thy lips have told.


2. Beyond the wealth of golden mines,
Thy precepts are my joy;
The way where thy commandment shines, 
Shall all my cares employ.


3. Folding thy law within my arms,
I rise in thought above;
And, musing on its sacred charms,
My heart o’erflows with love.


4. Bright beams are there, with gladness bright,
And heavenly raptures flow;
I will not lose the rich delight,
Which thy pure words bestow.
