1. Be perfect—holiness pursue;
In love be sure to dwell,
And God through Christ will comfort you—
So brethren, all farewell.


2. Be of one mind—give God your hearts,
And of his mercies tell,
Which he through grace to you imparts—
So brethren, all farewell.


3. Now live in peace and holy fear,
In love strive to excel;
For Christ, our King, will soon appear—
So brethren, all farewell.


4. The God of love and peace adore,
And on his mercy dwell;
We hope to meet on Canaan’s shore—
So brethren, all farewell.
